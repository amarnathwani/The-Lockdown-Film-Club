            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-black" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">I got the idea of a film club from our book club case study in the course. I, and some of my friends are the end users. During quarantine, we've found it difficult to connect, and so I thoought it would be nice to have a platform for a mutual passion, film. I decided to make my website a space for a film club, where we could discuss upcoming movies we want to see and plan limited trips to the cinema each month, give our collective thoughts and opinions on films we've seen recently, and share a little about who we are and how to contact us for fans of film who'd like to join our club.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">With some rough wireframes, I first laid out a generic website with a nav bar, and sections: Home, Upcoming, Discussion, About, and Contact. I had an idea quite early that I wanted to feature some of my favourite stills from films I love on the pages.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">I wanted a pretty simple, minimalistic website, with two interactive sections. Upcoming was a section I wanted to feauture new films on, and have the option to buy tickets for a pre-appointed day where the club gets together to watch it. An intorduction to each film and a section to buy tickets for the given day, time, and location were features that were essential to connecting our group to new films. The Discussion section was always meant to be more of a blog format. Users of our club can post about a movie and give it a score. Additional posts may be logged on the right to allow for navigation, and some sort of search mechanism to look for other films and our club's opinion on them. This is the section where we can share what we each like, and gain recommendations for what to watch next ourselves.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">The About section was always meant to be simple, with card like structures highlighting our club's founders. Contact was meant to be pretty simple too, with some basic information and a form to reach out with.</p>

            <!-- INSPIRATIONS -->
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-white" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">INSPIRATION</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">1. </em> As mentioned above, the book club case study had me thinking about ways in which I'd like to connect and share with my friends during lockdown.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">2. </em> I've always loved films and figured this would be a great way to connect a creative project to a passion of mine. I also took the opportunity to showcase some of my favourite films.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">3. </em> <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> website has always stood out to me as an example of simplicity and structure. Along with <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/">Pintrest</a> for the blog aspects of my page.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-black" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">1. </em> My website reads the viewport and adjusts for different devices. Working with the w3.css framework, I was able to utilise inbuilt breakpoints to adjust the navigation menu and columns of the website when resized.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">2. </em> I have kept my design quite minimal, therefore each section's information is procedural and clear. There are a few interactable areas, where I've kept the actions quite simple too. For someone that's just learning about the web, perhaps a first-time device user, they should be able to navigate it quite simply.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">3. </em> The website overall is quite light and does not contain heavy media elements. My images were compressed where they could be, making the website quite snappy. Persons with poor internet connection or bandwith issues should have no problem loading the site.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- USABILITY -->
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-white" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">USABILITY</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">1. </em> The website is responsive and can adapt to a variety of screen sizes. I've considered images and how they would move, text, modals and all else. It'll work well on phones, tablets and laptops. Being a light website, users would have a low task-time, and therefore would not be frustrated at long wait times for loading.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">2. </em> The layout is simple and navigation makes it clear as to where you are, and where you might want to go. Users of the web would be familiar with blog-like interfaces and pop-up modals. First-time users will find they are guided through the process naturally, and would be able to familiarise themselves quite quickly.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">3. </em> With the use of hover states and animations, users are clear with what they are interacting with. Modals are positioned at center screen, making them hard to miss too.</p>

            <!-- LEARNING -->

                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">LEARNING</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">1. </em> First and foremost, I used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">w3.css</a> framework to create my website. I used a mix of the w3.css templates and the tutorials for the framework.Additionally, I Youtube'd a tutorial on how to implement animations and positioning with the framework. </p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">2. </em> While I was featuring landing pages of my favourite films, I had to position my images while maintaining their aspect ratio. I google searched for and learned about the object-fit css property that allowed me to scale and reposition images the way I wanted to.</p>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px"><em class="w3-xxlarge">3. </em> Learning about the setTimeout javascript function from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGfTjA8qNDA">this Youtube tuorial</a> was essential to creating an automatic slideshow carousel for my Home page. The Coding Train channel has been extremely useful for logic and learning tools not just for WebDev, but also for Intro Programming.</p>

            <!-- What Worked? -->
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-white" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">WHAT WORKED?</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">Working with a framework that allowed me to efficiently plan my CSS made it significantly easier to design and build my website. When working on a site manually, it can feel clunky and repetetive. Due to the nature of w3.css, my designs maintained their proportionality and organisation. It allowed me to work with some creative freedom and not get bogged down by not being able to code what I had mapped out in my wireframes and mockups.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- IMPROVEMENTS -->
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64 w3-black" style="max-width:2000px">
                <h2 class="w3-wide w3-padding-32">IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
                <p class="w-3wide w3-content w3-padding 16 w3-justify w3-center" style="max-width: 800px">I would have liked to work more with javascript and my modals. Fully implementing a search feature on my Discussions page would have been the first improvement I made. Secondly, I would like to try using plugins, to allow my website to import information about movies, like their rating, cast, and other information, directly to areas of my website. It would then be able to update itself automatically, and be a step closer to a fully functioning website. Now that I undertand formatting, I would spend most of my time on another project implementing modularity and backend connectivity.</p>
